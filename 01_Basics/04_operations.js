let val=3
let neg_val=-val

//**-->for expnentiation

console.log("1"+2)//12
console.log(1+"2")//12
console.log("1"+2+2)//122
console.log(1+2+"2")//32
console.log(+true)//1
console.log(+"")//0

//all the above poractices are not considered to be good avoid using such practices and generate a good and readable code as readability is also important
